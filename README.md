# codeChallenges
Repository of code challenges I've solved. This will grow with time. 


## FizzBuzz 
Challenge: Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Fizz", for multiples of 5 print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Comments: I have two approaches to solving this. Run1 method works, but is slower than Run2 Method.
